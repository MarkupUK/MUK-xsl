<!-- NOTE: If you want to change any of these properties or add your
     own, do it in a 'properties.local.xml'.  That file, if it exists,
     will be read before this file so, thanks to Ant's rules for
     property definitions, any properties in that file will take
     precedence over property settings in this file. -->

<!-- NOTE: Use ${muk.basedir.converted} for files located relative
     to the 'muk' system directory. -->

<!-- NOTE: It is an Ant convention that Ant-style property references
     in property values, e.g., "${muk.basedir.converted}", will
     resolve to that property's value, provided the property was
     previously declared either earlier in the build process or
     earlier in the current property file. -->
